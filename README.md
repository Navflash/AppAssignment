Twilio Api 
the send sms button will send a message on my phone number , i used a trial phone number to send message to my phone 

Twitter api
In the end i used Tweetinvi as it has inbuilt authenticator for twitter , xamarin authenticator is causing some issues 
, By clicking send Tweet it will publish a tweet on my developer account . 

I am attaching photos of both these api working 


Also adding photo of push notification done by fcm
